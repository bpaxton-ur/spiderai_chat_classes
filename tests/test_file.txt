Sigma males are lone wolves respected for their abilities and down-to-earth confidence.
Sigmas are as successful and commanding as alpha males, but more independent and introverted. Social status doesn't matter to them, and they prefer to operate autonomously on their own terms
Sigma males are considered the rarest male archetype. They have a deep need for personal independence, similar to the “strong and silent” type.
